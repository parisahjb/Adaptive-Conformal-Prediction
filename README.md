# Adaptive Conformal Prediction Intervals Using Data-Dependent Weights
This paper presents a novel approach for computing non-conformity measures in regression conformal prediction, which incorporates the relevance between training instances and a given test sample. By assigning weights to the training points based on their proximity to the test sample, the proposed measure offers more adaptive prediction intervals than those solely based on absolute residuals. Empirical investigations conducted on several real-world regression data sets demonstrate that the data-dependent weights lead to more accurate predictions, resulting in tighter prediction intervals when the estimator is confident and wider prediction intervals when the estimator is uncertain. The findings underscore the effectiveness and validity of the prediction intervals generated by different conformal prediction methods.
