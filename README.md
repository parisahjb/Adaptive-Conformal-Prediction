Abstract:

This study presents a novel approach for computing non-conformity measures in regression conformal prediction, which incorporates the relevance between training instances and a given test sample. By assigning weights to the training points based on their proximity to the test sample, the proposed measure offers more adaptive prediction intervals than those solely based on absolute residuals. Empirical investigations conducted on several real-world regression data sets demonstrate that the data-dependent weights lead to more accurate predictions, resulting in tighter prediction intervals when the estimator is confident and wider prediction intervals when the estimator is uncertain. The findings underscore the effectiveness and validity of the prediction intervals generated by different conformal prediction methods.

utils.py": Contains essential utility functions that play a crucial role in computing prediction intervals using different conformal prediction methods. These functions enable the implementation of the following methods:
(Four existing methods):
Jackknife: The jackknife function performs the jackknife algorithm to calculate prediction intervals. It iteratively leaves out one data point at a time and fits the model to the reduced data. The residuals are used to obtain the lower and upper quantiles for the prediction intervals.

Jackknife+: The jackknife_plus function extends the jackknife algorithm by calculating prediction intervals for multiple test samples simultaneously. It incorporates the relevance between training instances and test samples using data-dependent weights, leading to more adaptive prediction intervals.

Cross-Validation (CV): The CV function implements the cross-validation algorithm to calculate prediction intervals. It divides the data into K folds, iterates through each fold as the test set, and uses the remaining folds as the training set. The residuals are then used to compute prediction intervals.

CV+: The CV_plus function extends the CV algorithm by incorporating multiple test samples and calculating prediction intervals using data-dependent weights, resulting in more adaptive predictions.

(Two new methods):
Weighted Jackknife+: The weighted_jackknife_plus function enhances the jackknife+ algorithm by calculating weights for each data point based on their proximity to the test sample. The weighted residuals are used to modify the prediction intervals, offering even greater adaptability.

Weighted CV+: The weighted_CV_plus function extends the CV+ algorithm by incorporating weighted residuals based on the inverse of the Euclidean distance between data points and test samples. This further enhances the adaptability of the prediction intervals.
